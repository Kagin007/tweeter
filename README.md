# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone.

Want to message with your friends on an app that arbitrarily cares about text length and uses *cute* cartoon profile pics? Then join Tweeter! The **hottest** messaging App.

# Features Include
- Feeling *lazy*? Autonomously scroll 'up' by clicking our fancy blue button that appears once you start scrolling down.
- Don't try to send ```<scripts>``` through our messager app! We have built-in ,state-of-the-art technologies that prevents such tomfollery!
- A one-page app means no more reloading webpages! You see **your** tweets as soon as you post them.
